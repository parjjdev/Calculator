      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold font-inter mb-4">What is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)?</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-[#252525]">
        Definition: Purchasing Power Parity is an economic theory that suggests that in the absence of transportation costs and barriers to trade, identical goods should have the same price when expressed in a common currency. This principle helps to assess whether currencies are undervalued or overvalued relative to one another based on the cost of a "basket of goods" in different countries.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-[#252525]">
        Importance: PPP is widely used by economists and analysts to compare economic productivity and living standards between nations. It provides insights into how much a currency can buy in terms of goods and services, which is crucial for international businesses, travelers, and investors.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold font-inter mb-2">How to Calculate PPP</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-[#252525]">
        The calculation of PPP can vary depending on what you aim to achieve. Here are the two primary methods:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 text-base">
        <li>
          Absolute PPP Calculation:
          <ul className="list-none list-inside ml-6"> 
            <li>Formula:</li>
            <li>PPP=Price of Goods in Country B/ Price of Goods in Country A * Exchange Rate</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2 ml-6"> 
            Example: If a hamburger costs $5 in the U.S. and 300 yen in Japan, the exchange rate would be calculated as:
            <br />
            Exchange Rate=5/300 = 0.0167
            <br />
            This indicates that $1 buys approximately 60 yen3.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Relative PPP Calculation:
          <p className="ml-6"> {/* Added ml-6 for paragraph alignment */}
            This approach considers inflation rates between two countries and adjusts the exchange rate accordingly over time. It helps predict future exchange rates based on expected inflation differentials4.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-4 ">Using a PPP Calculator: Step-by-Step Guide</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          Step 1: Input Details
          <p className="ml-6"> {/* Added ml-6 for paragraph alignment */}
            Enter the necessary information into the calculator, including:
            <br />
            The cost of specific goods or services in both currencies. The current exchange rate between the two currencies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2: Calculate
          <p className="ml-6"> {/* Added ml-6 for paragraph alignment */}
            Click the "Calculate" button. The calculator will process your inputs using real-time economic data to compute the PPP between the two currencies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3: Analyze Results
          <p className="ml-6"> {/* Added ml-6 for paragraph alignment */}
            The results will display how much purchasing power your currency has in comparison to another country. This analysis can help you make informed decisions regarding relocation, travel budgeting, or investment opportunities.
